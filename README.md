*This screenshot shows an example of the app after a user has submitted a goal and received a detailed, actionable plan generated by the AI. The output area displays the plan in the selected format, making it easy to follow and act on each step.*


### Example: Classifier Preventing Non-Goals

![Not a Goal Example](Graphics/Not-A-Goal.jpg)

*The app includes a built-in classifier that prevents non-goal submissions. When a user enters something that is not an actionable goal (such as a question or topic), the app displays a clear message explaining that the input is not a goal, along with a definition and examples of valid goals. This ensures only meaningful, actionable goals are processed by the AI.*

## Functions & Features

### Core Functions

- **Goal Input & Validation**
  - Users enter their goal in a text area.
  - The app uses rule-based logic to ensure the input is actionable (not just a topic or question).
- **Task Breakdown Generation**
  - Valid goals are sent to OpenAI’s GPT model.
  - The model returns a structured, easy-to-follow plan.
- **Output Formatting**
  - Users can choose from three output styles:
    - Standard (mix of paragraphs, bullets, and numbered lists)
    - Bullet List (all tasks as bullet points)
    - Numbered List (sequential, step-by-step)
- **Sidebar Controls**
  - **Model Selector:** Choose from available AI models.
  - **API Key Input:** Securely enter your OpenAI API key.
  - **Temperature Slider:** Adjust the creativity of AI responses.

### Visual & Usability Features

- Compact, minimalist layout with custom CSS for spacing and readability.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Clear feedback and error messages for invalid input.

## Testing, Implementation & Future Recommendations

### Testing & Development Scripts

- **test_classifier.py:**  
  Standalone Streamlit page for testing the goal classifier and OpenAI integration.  
  - Validates the goal classification logic.
  - Displays sample outputs and error handling.
  - Useful for refining logic before deployment.

### Implementation Notes

- The main logic resides in `app.py`.
- The app uses environment variables or sidebar input for API key security.
- All UI and logic are thoroughly commented for maintainability.

### Recommended Future Features

- Save and export generated plans.
- Integrate with popular task management tools (e.g., Todoist, Trello).
- Add user authentication for personalized experiences.
- Support for multi-step or recurring goals.
- Enhanced goal validation using NLP or LLMs for greater accuracy.

## Supported LLM Models

- **OpenAI:**
  - `gpt-3.5-turbo` (default)
  - Other OpenAI models can be easily configured
  - Requires your own OpenAI API key (never stored or uploaded)

## How to Run
1. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. **Set up your OpenAI API key:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
    - Or enter it directly in the app's sidebar

3. **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
4. **Open in your browser** at the URL provided by Streamlit (typically http://localhost:8501)

## App Structure & Logic
- **Main Components:**
  - `app.py`: Primary application file with UI and API integration
  - `main.py`: Backend logic for the task generation agent
  - Custom CSS for optimal layout and spacing

- **Key Features:**
  - Goal validation to ensure proper input
  - Dynamic prompt engineering based on selected output format
  - Temperature control for adjusting AI creativity
  - Responsive design with optimized spacing

- **How It Works:**
  1. User enters a goal in the text area
  2. App validates if the input is a proper goal
  3. User selects desired output format (Standard, Bullet List, or Numbered List)
  4. OpenAI API processes the goal with format-specific instructions
  5. Response is displayed with appropriate formatting and spacing

## Security Notes
- **No API keys or sensitive data are ever stored or uploaded.**
- `.env`, OpenAI key files, and personal notes are excluded from the repository.
- Only public, non-sensitive code and assets are included.
