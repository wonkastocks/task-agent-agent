# Project Timeline: Achieve your Goals App

## May 10, 2025

### Major Documentation and Codebase Improvements
- **README Overhaul:** Completely restructured the README for clarity and professionalism. Added an Overview, Interface Screenshot, Functions & Features, Testing/Implementation, Future Recommendations, and a Summary section.
- **Screenshot Management:** Added a new app interface screenshot to the README with a descriptive caption. Ensured all referenced images are documented and unused images are identified.
- **Code Commenting:** Added thorough, sectioned comments throughout `app.py` explaining all logic, UI elements, and design decisions for future maintainability.
- **File Cleanup:** Removed unused files such as `guardrails.py` after confirming they were not referenced in the main codebase.
- **Timeline Update:** Updated `timeline.md` to reflect all recent changes and improvements.
